# **Fracture Pattern Analysis Using AI**

## **Overview**
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze fracture patterns in materials. The model is trained on the **NEU Metal Surface Defects Dataset** to classify surface defects into six categories:
1. Crazing
2. Inclusion
3. Patches
4. Pitted Surface
5. Rolled-in Scale
6. Scratches

The project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can assist in identifying and classifying material defects, contributing to automated quality assurance in industrial settings.
